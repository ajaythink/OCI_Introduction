1. You have subscribed to an OCI region that has one availability domain. You want to deploy a highly available application with two servers and a 2-node database. How would you place the components to maintain the high availability of the application?
Place the servers in one fault domain and the database nodes in another fault domain.
High availability is not possible as there is only one availability domain in the region.
Place all the components in the same fault domain.
Place one server and a DB node in one fault domain, and the second server and DB node in another fault domain. (*)
Correct. In this scenario, distributing the servers and database nodes across different fault domains within the same availability domain would provide protection against the failure of a single fault domain. If one fault domain experiences a failure, the other would remain unaffected, ensuring the high availability of the application.
